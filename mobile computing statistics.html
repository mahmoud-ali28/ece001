,ح.About a decade ago, one buzzword in the IT field was quickly making its way into the spotlight.

Everyone was talking about “the cloud“!

Back then, people knew very little about this emerging tech, so naturally, there were a lot of questions:

How does the cloud work?

Is it any different from the Internet?

How can I “join” the cloud?

Is it safe to store my data there?

As funny as some of those questions may sound to you today, they were absolutely on point a few years ago.

Cloud computing statistics reveal the exponential growth of the industry since then. Estimated at just $24.65 billion in 2010, it has already surpassed the $100 billion mark and looking to reach $150 billion by the end of 2020.
